# Task: Write a script that takes a user input(string) converts it to an integer, performs a calculation, and then prints the result.

# 1. Prompt the user to enter a number
user_input = input("Please enter a number: ")

# 2. Convert the input to an integer
user_number = int(user_input)

# 3. Perform a calculation (e.g., multiply by 2)
calculation_result = user_number * 2

# 4. Print the result
print("The result of multiplying your number by 2 is:", calculation_result)
